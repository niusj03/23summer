Furthermore, detail the connection between transferable features and pretrain-finetune mechanism.\n The first layer of a deep neural network learns simple features are generalizable across tasks. As the layers get deeper, the neurons become more specialized to their original task, making them less transferable to new tasks. Fine-tuning a pre-trained network on a new task can be difficult due to optimization difficulties related to splitting the network. The transferability of features can be quantified by measuring the performance of a network when transferring between dis-similar tasks. Networks trained on a natural target task perform better when transferring to a man-made target task than vice versa. 6. The performance of a network can be improved by initializing the first few layers with random, untrained weights. The pretrain weight can utilize the transferable feature for downstream tasks  Material #  I. The second week slide from Zebin Yun.\nII.

Introduction: Concept and Mechanism of Self-Distillation\n Introduce the basic concept and structure of self-distillation. Discuss the mechanisms of self-distillation and its relation with Knowledge distillation. Discuss the basic idea of contrastive learning and its pretext task (SimCLR). The learning objective: A representation mapping invariant of transformation(augmentation). Alignment and uniformity are two key requirement. Collapse(trivial solution). Optimal but unwanted result. Basic concept in preventing collapse.  II. Contrastive Learning without Negative Samples\n Introduce BYOL, a self-distillation model learning without negative pairs. Connections between BYOL and other works Provide some illuminations about why BYOL performs well and avoids collapse  III. Examination of BYOL-like model: Road to prevent collapse\n Mythology: Studying the components of the model through ablation to understand whether they are necessary in preventing collapse. Hypothesis proposed: Procedures taken are actually solving an underlying optimization problem. The optimization is EM-like and thus do well in searching for a representation. Validating the hypothesis vis experience.  IV. Combining Transformer with Self-Distillation\n Discuss the difficulty faced by the ViT(Vision Transformer). Specifically, the tokenizer of images. Tokenizer learn better deep semantic information using self-distillation. Discussing the trade-off between alignment and uniformity in ViT.
