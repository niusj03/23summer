# Acknowledgement

Eight weeks have flown by, and as our self-supervised learning seminar comes to an end, my heart is full.

I want to send a big 'thank you' to all of you. Your questions, your intelligence, and your genuine curiosity made every meeting memorable. We dived deep into the world of self-supervised learning, but what I'll cherish the most are the bonds we formed and the shared passion for the scientific world.

A special shoutout to our each keynote speakers â€“ your presentations and insights added that extra sprinkle of magic to our journey.

As we wrap up, my wish for each one of you is simple: Keep that spark alive. Keep questioning. Keep exploring. And remember the good times we had.

Let's promise to carry forward the warmth, the joy, and the love for learning. And who knows, maybe our paths will cross again in another exciting adventure.

Until then, take care and wishing you all the very best.

Best wishes,

Shengjie.
